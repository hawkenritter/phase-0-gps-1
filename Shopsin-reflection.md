#Jen's reflections after GPS 1.1

##What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
* git push vs. fetch and merge
* Resolving merge conflicts
* Pushing from a specific branch vs the master branch

##What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
* Commit message best practices - I did not realize that these should be in present tense vs past tense
* Markdown file syntax of how to show a link and code snippets (I really needed this review)
* Git best practices, inlcuding, committing every 30 minutes, pulling from the master repo before starting work, communication among peers to avoid merge conflicts
* Merge conflicts are not scary, but can be relatively easy to fix.

##What questions did you ask your pair and guide?
* I asked if we needed to move to a different branch or directory before pushing to GitHub. You should actually be in the branch that you are wanting to push, otherwise the changes you made in that branch won't get pushed to the cloud.
* I asked about the correct syntax to use in a markdown language to create italics, code snippets, and links. I was able to get this information from my navigator in addition to looking it up online at the same time.
* I asked what the difference was between push, fetch and merge. I now understand that push is the same as doing both fetch and merge.

##How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
* My first experience pairing in a GPS was great. We had some technical difficulties with Hawken's internet cutting in and out, but we were still able to communicate clearly and John was able to clarify items in the assignment as well as answer any questions we had along the way. I also really appreciated that our guide gave an overview of both commit message best practices, as well as git best practices after my pair and I both answered what we knew.
