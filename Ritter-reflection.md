What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS Session? I feel pretty comfortable with the basic git. commands but I have been struggling with understanding the theory behind git and how save points are organized.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS? Maintaining good git workflow was definitly discussed a lot during the GPS which was helpful for me because though I feel confident with the basic commands, using git in practice is still very new to me.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide? I asked my guide questions about git theory as well as some pull, push syntax. My pair was also pretty confident with all of the git commands so most of the questions we asked eachother dealt with syntax. I feel like we were a very strong pair.

What still confuses me about Git? Though John, my guide, definitely helped clarify git hgih level theory I am still confused about save points and jumping back to different commits if something happens to your master branch.

How was your first GPS experience? It was great! I definitely prefer coding with someone else vs just doing it by myself. I have already completed my first pair session and between that and the GPS I feel like I learned a ton.
